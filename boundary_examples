Additional notes/references

(1) - These may be realised as fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic manifolds.

      Conversely:
      In dimension 1 these are all surface groups (convergence group theorem).
      In dimension 2 these may all be closed manifold groups (Cannon conjecture).
      If $G$ is torsion free with boundary homeomorphic to a sphere of dimension $\geq 5$ then $$G$$ is the fundamental group of a closed aspherical manifold (Bartels--L\"uck--Weinberger).
      But there exist closed aspherical manifolds with negatively curved fundamental groups such that the boundary is not spherical (Davis-Januszkiewicz).
      In general, if $G$ is torsion free with boundary homeomorphic to a sphere of dimension $\geq n$ then $G$ is a Poincar\'e duality group of dimension $n+1$.

(2) - These may be realised as fundamental groups of compact hyperbolic manifolds with non-empty totally geodesic boundary.

      In dimension 1 the converse would follow from the Cannon conjecture (Kapovch--Kleiner).

(3) - This is the generic case (Champetier).
      In particular it arises as the boundary of free-by-cyclic groups (Kapovich--Kleiner) and of right-angled Coxeter groups (Benakli).

(4) - The two dimensional Menger compactum occurs as the boundary of a hyperbolic right-angled Coxeter group (Drani\v{s}nikov).
      The three dimensional Menger comapctum occurs as boundaries of right angled hyperbolic buildings, so they are boundaries of cocompact lattices in the automorphism groups of these buildings (Dymara--Osajda).

(5) - Dranishnikov constructed hyperbolic right-angled Coxeter groups with Pontryagin surfaces $\Pi_p$ as boundaries.
      Together with a result of Fisher this method gives the Pontryagin sphere.

(6) - This is due to Przytycki--\'Swi\c{}atkowski in dimension 3 and \'Swi\c{a}tkowski in arbitrary dimension.

To do:
Davis and Januszkiewicz's hyperbolisation of complexes is supposed to give other examples, including homology spheres
Find out about trees of manifolds
More generally, think about Coxeter groups
